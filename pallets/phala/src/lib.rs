//! Phala Pallets
//!
//! This is the central crate of Phala tightly-coupled pallets.
//!
//! - `phala_legacy`: The legacy `pallet-phala`; will be retired gradually
//! - `mq`: The message queue to connect components in the network
//! - `registry`: Manages the public key of offchain components (i.e. workers and contracts)
//! - `mining`: Manages mining lifecycle, reward and slashes
//! - `stakepool`: Pool for collaboratively mining staking
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! Now `phala-pallet` is still functional, but it will be gradually deconstructed as separate
//! pallets.
//!
//! The `mq` pallet has a basic implementation and it's supposed to work. The `registry` pallet
//! only has very basic API for testing.
